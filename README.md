# Red-Black-Tree

Implementation of  a Red Black Tree

A red-black tree is a binary search tree with one extra bit of storage per node: its color, which can be either RED or BLACK. 

By constraining the node colors on any simple path from the root to a leaf, red-black trees ensure that no such path is more than twice as long as any other, so that   the tree is approximately balanced.

A red-black tree is a binary tree that satisfies the following.
Red-black properties:
*  Every node is either red or black.
*  The root is black.
*  Every leaf (NIL) is black.
*  If a node is red, then both its children are black.
*  For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.
